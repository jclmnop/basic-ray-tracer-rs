# Instructions
## Install Rust
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to 
install Rust. 

Or, you can use your system's package manager (if you have one) to download and
install rustup (the rust toolchain). For example, with homebrew on MacOS you 
would simply run

```shell
brew install rustup
```

## Install GTK4
Follow the relevant installation instructions for your OS:
- [Windows](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation_windows.html)
- [MacOS](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation_macos.html)
- [Linux](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation_linux.html)

## Run
From within the project directory, run the following command in your terminal. 
```shell
cargo run --release
```
It may take a little while to compile for the first time, so go have a cup of
tea or something.
